# ESP32-Based-Real-Time-CO2-Monitoring-System-with-On-Device-Display
Real-time CO₂ monitoring system using the ESP32-S3-Touch-LCD-1.69 and Sensirion SCD41 sensor. Data is displayed on a 1.69" touch screen with a custom GUI built in SquareLine Studio. Runs offline, measures CO₂, temperature, and humidity, and provides visual air quality feedback.
